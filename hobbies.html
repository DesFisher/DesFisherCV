        <h1>About Me</h1>
    </div>
        <p> I've been living in Colorado since 2014 and have been very happy here since then. There are so many adventures to be had here and getting to try each one is an amazing experience. I began learning basic HTML and CSS back in 2020.  At the time due to a personal issue I had to give up 
            the possibility to become a web developer as I wanted.  I am excited that I can finally follow my dream and help
            create amazing websites.  Sometimes working with one of my three teenage daughters who  specializes in web animations,
            I strive to make the websites I build as unique as the clients asking for them.
