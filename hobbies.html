        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I began learning basic HTML and CSS back in 2020.  At the time due to a personal issue I had to give up 
            the possibility to become a web developer as I wanted.  I am excited that I can finally follow my dream and help
            create amazing websites.  Sometimes working with one of my three teenage daughters who  specializes in web animations,
            I strive to make the websites I build as unique as the clients asking for them.

        <h3>Family</h3>
        <p>
                I am a mother to three beautiful daughters, amy oldest being 14 and my twins are now 12. We love animals, having 2 dogs, 2 birds  as well as their rat. 
            We have our family activities such as hiking, airsoft battles and a joint love of chocolates.
